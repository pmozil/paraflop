# Paraflop

The name was generated by [this word does not exist](https://thisworddoesnotexist.com).

I love this site.

I thouroughly and passionately dislike all OpenGL,
and that's why the project was made with Vulkan. 
As terrible as this was, I enjoyed it the most out of all the recent projects I made.

# Building

## Dependencies

You need Vulkan, GLM, GLFW, and the LunarG SDK. 
Here's the packange manager commands.

### Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install vulkan-tools \
libvulkan-dev \
vulkan-validationlayers-dev \
spirv-tools \
libglfw3-dev \
libglm-dev \
libxxf86vm-dev \
libxi-dev
```

### Fedora
```
sudo dnf install vulkan-tools \
vulkan-loader-devel \
mesa-vulkan-devel \
vulkan-validation-layers-devel \
glfw-devel \
glm-devel \
libXi-devel \
libXxf86vm-devel
```

### Arch
<b style="color: #ff0000">Use glfw-x11 is you are not on wayland</b>
```
sudo pacman -Syu vulkan-devel \
glfw-wayland \
glm \
libxi \
libxxf86vm
```

## Compiling
I mean, it's a CMake project. I'll still leave the commands here, just in case you're lazy.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pmozil/paraflop
cd paraflop
cmake .
cmake --build .
```

Now, to run this just do
```bash
./build/paraflop

```
