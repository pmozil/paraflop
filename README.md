# Paraflop

The name was generated by [thisword does not exist](https://thisworddoesnotexist.com).
I love this site.

I thouroughly and passionately dislike all this, especially OpenGL.
That's why the project was made with Vulkan. 
As terrible as this was, I enjoyed it the most out of all the recent projects I made.

# Building

I mean, it's a CMake project. I'll still leave the commands here, just in case you're lazy.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pmozil/paraflop
cd paraflop
cmake .
cmake --build .
```

Now, to run this just do
```bash
./build/paraflop

```
